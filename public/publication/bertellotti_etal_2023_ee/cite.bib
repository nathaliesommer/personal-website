abstract = {Metacommunity theory has advanced scientific understanding of how species in-teractions and spatial processes influence patterns of biodiversity and communitystructure across landscapes. While the central tenets of metacommunity theory havebeen promoted as pivotal considerations for conservation management, few field ex-periments have tested the validity of metacommunity predictions. Here, we testedone key prediction of metacommunity theory—that decreasing habitat connectivityshould erode metacommunity structure by hindering species movement betweenpatches. For 2 years, we manipulated an experimental old-field grassland ecosystemvia mowing to represent four levels of habitat connectivity: (1) open control, (2) fullconnectivity, (3) partial connectivity, and (4) no connectivity. Within each treatmentplot (10 × 10 m, n = 4 replicates), we measured the abundance and diversity (i.e., alphaand beta) of both flying and ground arthropods using sticky and pitfall traps, respec-tively. We found that the abundance and diversity of highly mobile flying arthropodswere unaffected by habitat connectivity, whereas less mobile ground arthropodswere highly impacted. The mean total abundance of ground arthropods was 2.5× and2× higher in the control and partially connected plots compared to isolated patches,respectively. We also reveal that habitat connectivity affected the trophic interac-tions of ground arthropods, with predators (e.g., wolf spiders, ground spiders) beinghighly positively correlated with micro-detritivores (springtails, mites) but not macro-detritivores (millipedes, isopods) as habitat connectivity increased. Together thesefindings indicate that changes in habitat connectivity can alter the metacommunitystructure for less mobile organisms such as ground arthropods. Because of their es-sential roles in terrestrial ecosystem functioning and services, we recommend thatconservationists, restoration practitioners, and land managers include principles ofhabitat connectivity for ground arthropods when designing biodiversity managementprograms.},
