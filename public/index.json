I understood its benefits for me, for my baby, for our bond, for my bank account, and for the environment. I also knew there would be (potentially insurmountable) challenges, and I would need all the help I could get.\nWe got off to a rocky start. My newborn was nearly hospitalized after losing too much weight after birth. On the advice of her doctor, we tried — several times — offering formula. Each time ended in projectile vomit, and lots of tears.\nMercifully, blessedly, thankfully, my university health plan covered unlimited visits with a lactation consultant. Within two weeks, we successfully established nursing. There were later bumps in the road (oversupply, then undersupply, then plugged ducts), but it no longer felt like a life-or-death situation.\nWhen my daughter was six weeks old, the first formula recall notice was issued. The situation worsened throughout 2022. While the news coverage has slowed, on-the-ground shortage remains. Despite actively looking in every store I enter, I still have not seen formula on the shelves.\nMy daughter is now 11 months old and has not needed formula supplementation, thanks in large part due to the support of my spouse, healthcare workers, and daycare providers. It is a deep privilege to exclusively breastfeed my daughter, a challenge and a bond that I am daily grateful for. Soon, I will no longer be my child’s primary source of nutrition, though we may continue nursing.\nAs I approach the end of my pumping journey, I felt compelled to write a long-form primer on breastfeeding, for people who have never been a nursing parent. Before giving you recommendations, here are the things you need to know about breastfeeding and pumping.\nStuff You Should Know 1. Lactation is maintained in a supply-demand relationship.\nSupply drops when there isn’t sufficient demand. This requires that milk is removed (by a baby or by a breast pump) with high frequency. A rule of thumb is every three hours. 2. Milk needs to be removed from the breasts with high frequency.\nIf milk is not removed with high frequency, there is an immediate risk to the nursing parent ranging from engorgement and plugged ducts to mastitis. Missing even one feed or pump can be painful. 3. Breast pumps are not a perfect substitute for direct breastfeeding.\nPumping without proximity to your child can be stressful and psychologically taxing. Time apart from your child while exclusively pumping can still cause a drop in your supply. 4. Human milk (or formula) is the primary source of nutrition for the first YEAR of life.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive nursing for the first six months of life. That means no formula supplementation. Solids can be introduced at six months, but human milk should remain the primary source of nutrition until twelve months. Only after twelve months can cow’s milk be introduced. The AAP further recommends that nursing should continue through age 2 years. 5. Safe storage of human milk is logistically complex for working parents.\nPumped milk needs to be kept in a refrigerator, and either be used within 4 days or frozen. Thawed milk needs to be used within 24 hours, and it can never be refrozen. In addition, some nursing parents may have excess lipase activity, causing a soap-like taste in thawed milk, which most infants refuse to take. For those still keeping track, milk pumped during the workday on Friday cannot be used on Monday without being frozen. CDC guidelines for human milk storage 6. Parents who pump need clean, private spaces.\nPumping needs to be done with clean hands, on clean surfaces, with clean pump parts. Some nursing parents may also require access to an outlet to operate or charge their pump. Even if someone has a wearable pump, they will still need a clean space to remove the pump, transfer milk into a storage bag for refrigeration, and wash the pump parts. If you are in a position of power and want to support graduate student parents, keep reading. While this is generally good advice for supporting student-parents regardless of how they feed their children, I offer specific recommendations around breastfeeding. Recommendations 1. Talk to your students\nBefore they return to in-person work, check in to offer your support. Acknowledge that the transition can be challenging, physically and emotionally. Ask if they will need the time and room space for nursing, and ensure the necessary systems are in place (see above). Legally, employees are entitled to some minimum standard of sufficient time and space to pump human milk. Ensure your basic compliance and support your sleep-deprived student. 2. Optimize the pumping space\nProvide a private, clean space, in their primary building, with the ability to lock the room. Do not require a separate email message or approval to access the room.

These applications take time, energy, and a lot of mental grit! Yet writing a fellowship application, regardless of the outcome, can provide clarity and direction. The opportunity to dive into your personal story as well as your interests and career goals, is a unique chance to critically examine your path.\nBelow you will find some tips and guidance for helping you on your journey.\nGetting Started Cast your net wide: Oftentimes there is more than one fellowship opportunity that will help you reach your goal. For example, if you’d like to earn a Masters degree several different fellowships can help you attain that objective (Fulbright, Marshall, Rhodes, Mitchell, NSF GRFP). Casting your net wide and applying to several fellowships increases the likelihood you will be able to ultimately carry out your plans.\nRead the instructions: Does the grant have a strict word limit? Do they require certain citation formats or document settings? Do they require you to break your application into sections? Before you start, getting a handle on the specifics will help you structure your application to meet the requirements.\nGet a feel for the grant: Each fellowship has its own “personality”, so to speak. For example, the Fulbright commission cares deeply about international cultural exchange, while the Truman seeks a candidate that is a “change agent”. Often, simply looking at the fellowship’s website will give you a sense of what type of candidate the granting agency is excited about. Understanding the feel for the fellowship will help you decide if you are a good fit for the opportunity as well as provide context that you can use to tailor your application.\nStart with a hook: Opening a statement with a hook is an important step for engaging your reader. In a personal essay, start with a story that gives the reader a bit of insight into who you are as a person. In a research statement, think about the problem your research will address. How can you frame the work in an accessible way that gets the reader excited about the work you are going to do?\nUse stories: The best way for a committee to get to know you is to tell stories. Through stories, you are able to not only create an engaging narrative, but also provide insight into who you are as a person. In other words, show: don’t tell. Here is an example of both a statement, and a story that can better present the information in that statement.\nStatement: For my senior thesis, I won an Atlantic Coast Conference-International Academic Collaborative Research Grant to work in the lab of French Professor Jane Doe, conducting a paleoclimate reconstruction of Holocene temperatures in the region.\nStory: I stumbled upon what became a life-changing opportunity during my semester abroad. Interested in a professor’s lecture on climate, I signed up for office hours. I expected to only get a few minutes to pick her brain, but to my surprise, I was the only student there. I was captivated by her research and personal story of being one of the first women in the field of paleoecology. Two hours later, I left inspired and fueled with passion to overcome my insecurities. I had a thesis topic and a commitment to science I no longer felt I needed to suppress. That spring I won an Atlantic Coast Conference-International Academic Collaborative Research Grant, which allowed me to return to France to conduct my own, independent paleoclimate reconstruction of the Holocene.\nIn the story, the author is able not only communicate the facts in the statement, but also give insight into the type of student they are. They are 1) the type of student who is willing to engage with professors, 2) a student who overcame insecurities, 3) able to work in international settings. Also, it’s much more interesting to read!\nPersonal Essay Tips Don’t feel shackled to a chronological story: When writing a personal statement it can be easy to tell your story chronologically: consider breaking out of this mold. After all, how many applications do you think the committee reads that start with a story or statement about the candidate’s childhood? Instead, think about how you can organize your essay around themes that demonstrate your skills. For example, organizing paragraphs that focus on your leadership, research, outreach, teaching, community involvement, etc. can help you write an essay that seamlessly time travels.\nBe authentic: Your essay should read like you wrote it, with all your personality traits and quirks! The best advice I have ever gotten was to have a close friend of family member read my first and last draft of my personal statements only for authenticity. Does what I wrote speak to me as a person? Often a trusted confidant can help you determine what is missing.\nShow don’t tell: This advice is so important it needs to be repeated!

I was in a moderate state of panic for the six weeks leading up to exams, and a last minute schedule change (that pushed my exams forward by five days) sent me into sheer terror. The written period was a complete blur. I burrowed into my couch and only left when my spouse coaxed me into neighborhood walks. In contrast, the oral exam is burned into my memory. One too many stumbles during my prospectus presentation, one too many long pauses while I tried to parse out the question from my committee. The infinity waiting in the Zoom breakout room to hear if I’d passed… Then the floodgates opening with relief and surprise and pride when I passed with distinction and suddenly, it was all over.\nI didn’t experience a post-quals slump so much as a post-quals dump. By that, I mean everything that I had put on pause came rushing back.\nDon’t know what you’ve got til it’s gone Quals gave me permission to drop everything. I turned off my email / text / Slack / WhatsApp / calendar reminders / social media. I was in an extremely privileged position to be able to do that for my personal life. But at the time, I didn’t recognize how unique this situation would be for my work life. When is it not only acceptable, but highly encouraged, to be that unreachable? The permission to fully explore a set of ideas was a gift, and not the capital e Examination it was made out to be.\nTurning on my notifications and resuming my other responsibilities shattered my attention. I wanted to keep thinking about those ideas, but I no longer had the socially respected reason to be MIA. I have since abandoned a number of platforms and do everything I can to leave my notifications “off”, but it is still not the same.\nEnvisioning a different way of doing quals The qualifying exam needs some reframing, structurally and colloquially. The exam process should not exist as an Academic Tradition, but something that is student-oriented with specific objectives. If departments need a so-called weed-out exam, they should reconsider their admissions standards. If departments want to give students an opportunity to demonstrate their subject matter expertise and explore new ideas, they should frame it as such. Here’s my vision:\nAdvancing to candidacy. Students will set aside a period of one month to allow for synthetic writing and conversations that will inform the remainder of their dissertation. The writing weeks are a time for uninterrupted deep work and the creation of new theories. Following the written period, students will have 4 hours of undivided attention from their committee – an opportunity to discuss the ideas in their prospectus and their newly written work with fellow experts. During this month, students will receive full structural support from the department to facilitate uninterrupted deep work, which could include teaching relief, full time child care, and/or meal vouchers.\nHazing, by definition, includes: (a) ‘a power differential between those in a group and those who want to join a group, or between senior and junior members of a group’ and (b) ‘an intentional initiation rite, practice or tradition involved’.\nAn overall reframing of the qualifying exam ought to (1) acknowledge and minimize the power differential between students and committee members by validating students as subject-matter experts and (2) include carefully crafting the specific objectives of the qualifying exam and turn those objectives into articulated policies within a student handbook. These objectives should be revisited and revised frequently.\nI should be clear: I did not feel that my qualifying exam came close to hazing. I learned a lot and I am grateful for the experience. But, my experience is not universal. And there is ample room for improvement.\nSome tools and resources that saved me during quals and might help you too :) LaTex + natbib\ns/o to my lab-mate Kristy Ferraro for introducing me to LaTex Mendeley Evernote Advice from older grad students ","date":1616198400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1616198400,"objectID":"d2a3e222b8efb5665c952d06356b4a46","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/quals-reflection/","publishdate":"2021-03-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/quals-reflection/","section":"post","summary":"In the moment, I wouldn’t say quals was fun.

At least, not one that involves travel and working alongside other people. But, a year in, I am doing some reflection on all the ways my research plans and processes have changed, for better and for worse.\nThis has been the Year of Side Projects (aka my pandemic-pivot-projects). Uncertain field seasons, a loudly ticking funding clock, and general loneliness drove my maximizer-tendencies to new heights. I started saying ‘yes’ to everything that came my way, research and otherwise. I told myself I was being strategic; that it was a long term necessity to be flexible and adaptable. At the start, it felt like floundering. Within a few months, it felt like drowning.\nFlexible or floundering? via GIPHY\nOf course, the temptation of the side project is nothing new. It’s hard to turn down an interesting opportunity, let alone one that involves cool people. But it’s doubly hard to turn down an interesting project with cool people, when you have no idea if you’ll be able to carry out your planned dissertation. In practice, this meant it was very easy for me to break my own boundaries. My primary challenge was identifying when and how to say ’no’.\nFinding @gbosslet’s decision algorithm changed my process. It works for research, but I’ve found it applies to non-research opportunities as well. For me, it removes all the emotion and second guessing, and helps me enforce the boundaries that make me a more productive scientist.\nOn the whole, I’m grateful for my pandemic-pivot-projects. They forced me to pause and think more carefully about my dissertation. They also opened new doors to topics and people that I would’ve otherwise left closed. But, they showed me the consequences of saying ‘yes’ too often.\nSometimes, saying ’no’ is good.\n","date":1612915200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612915200,"objectID":"c0a5ea9d2263f0e5764793680ae6cc2d","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/saying-no/","publishdate":"2021-02-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/saying-no/","section":"post","summary":"I can’t say I would recommend doing a PhD during a pandemic.
