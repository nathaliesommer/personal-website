      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://schmitz.environment.yale.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Schmitz Lab at the Yale School of the Environment&lt;/a&gt; is recruiting a recent grad for a 1-year paid fellowship. The fellow will design an independent project on any topic relating to food webs, ecosystem function, evolutionary ecology, and climate change, as part of a larger NSF project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fellow would be based in New Haven CT, with a flexible start date of Sept 1 2021. The fellow will work with the PIs, postdoc, and doctoral students to develop an independent research project, with the goal of generating a first-authored manuscript and presenting at conferences. We will also provide professional development to prepare the fellow for next steps in a STEM career or graduate school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fellow will be funded by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2021/nsf21085/nsf21085.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;National Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, specifically for recent grads who want to pursue a STEM career, but were unable to have a research experience as an undergraduate student due to pandemic-related interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eligibility:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US citizen or permanent resident&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completed a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree but not currently enrolled in another degree program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Priority placed on students from underrepresented groups, veterans, or those who have not participated in any kind of research experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some level of comfort around spiders and ticks (or willingness to be uncomfortable) is preferred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interested folks should email &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:nathalie.sommer@yale.edu&#34;&gt;nathalie.sommer@yale.edu&lt;/a&gt; with a copy of their cv and brief biosketch (1-paragraph max). Applications for the NSF REPS program are due on July 2nd, so please get in touch as soon as possible. Consideration of candidates will begin June 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
