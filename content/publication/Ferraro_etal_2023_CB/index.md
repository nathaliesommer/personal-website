abstract: Conservation science is a morally motivated ﬁeld, with implicit and explicit values built into its practice. As such, conservationists must engage with conservation ethics to interrogate underlying values. We examine cutting-edge ecological science and contemporary ethics to revisit two conservation norms that have become dogmatic in the ﬁeld; ecological collectives, but not individual animals, are valuable, and anthropomorphism should be staunchly avoided. Emerging studies demonstrate that individuals and their intraspeciﬁcvariation can be instrumentally valuable for conservation science, and there is an emerging consensus within environmental philosophy around the moral worth of individuals. Thus, we suggest conservation science should explicitly recognize the value of individuals. We also argue that avoiding anthropomorphism is detrimental to conservation because critical anthropomorphism enables a more nuanced scientiﬁc approach -- allowing conservationists to ask enlightened questions with creativity and compassion. We provide evidence that both dogmatic norms are scientiﬁcally and morally outdated and propose new normative values to push conservation towards more robust science and ethical practice.
