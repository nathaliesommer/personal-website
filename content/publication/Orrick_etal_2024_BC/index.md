abstract: The increased occurrence of human-wildlife interactions, due to climate change, land use change, habitat loss, and other anthropogenic impacts, necessitates better mitigation or adaptation. At the same time, developments in conservation ethics are converging on the need to recognize and value both human and non-human values within conservation practice. Better understanding of negative human-wildlife interactions can improve conservation management. In this paper, we interrogate what human-wildlife conflict is, who is involved, why it happens, and how we can better mitigate its occurrence. We describe how centering both human and non-human individuals allows wildlife management to leverage interdisciplinary tools for both better mitigation and ethical practices. We highlight existing interdisciplinary tools such as critical anthropomorphism, personhood, agency, and personality which can be used to conduct individual-based management strategies, as well as other tools that are already used to identify, understand, and monitor individuals. Ultimately, by centering the needs and perspectives of individuals, we assert that a more nuanced understanding of human-wildlife conflict can be achieved, leading to the development of effective and inclusive management strategies.
