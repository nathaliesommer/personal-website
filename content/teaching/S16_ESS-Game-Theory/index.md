A mini guest lecture and in-class activity on evolutionary stable strategies (ESS) and game theory. The activity teaches the theory of social cooperation via an iterative Prisoner's Dillemna. This was delivered during my first TA position for BIOL 312 Evolution of Organisms at the College of William & Mary.
