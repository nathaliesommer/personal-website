My research applies ecological stoichiometry to scale the consequences of evolution directly from individuals to ecosystems. I work on topics ranging from intraspecific variation and plasticity, to the role of predators in ecosystems. Driven by my dual interests in individual variation and the ecosystem holism, I also write about ethical frameworks for conservation.
