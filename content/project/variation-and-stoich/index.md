Ecological stoichiometry traces elements and their ratios through organisms, populations, communities, and ecosystems to explain mechanisms underpinning ecological interactions. I use a stoichiometric approach to understand how *evolutionary processes* might scale directly to ecosystem-level elemental flows. This approach requires understanding how much variation there is among individuals of a population, the strength of stoichiometric homeostasis across populations, and how various stressors--including predators, resource availability, and temperature--affect the stoichiometric phenotype. The goal of this work is a conceptual integration of evolutionary and ecosystem processes.
