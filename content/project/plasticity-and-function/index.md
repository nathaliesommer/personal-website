Phenotypic plasticity, or the ability of a single genotype to express different phenotypes in different environments, is the predominant way in which individuals and populations can cope with environmental variability, both within and across generations. Yet, not all forms of phenotypic plasticity are the same. Even within a species, different populations can express different types of plasticity to mitigate the same environmental stressor [(Rosenblatt et al. 2019)](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.2643). My research explores how different forms of plasticity in animals can impact ecosystem state and function, across both space and time. The outcome of this work is important for understanding how animals respond to climate variability and the ecosystem-level consequences of those responses.
