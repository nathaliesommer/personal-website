I am interested in the myriad ways animal behavior manifests in ecological communities, from flexible habitat use under environmental stressors to connecting seemingly distinct systems (e.g. plant-based vs detrital-based food webs). Animal behavior drives much of my thinking about eco-evolutionary feedbacks in ecosystems.
